# Data Wrangling Tutorial
Introduction
Welcome to the Data Wrangling Tutorial! In this tutorial, we will explore the concept of data wrangling and learn how to clean, transform, and prepare data using Python. Data wrangling is a crucial step in the data analysis process, involving tasks such as handling missing values, data cleaning, feature engineering, and data formatting.

We will primarily use two powerful libraries in Python for data wrangling:

Pandas: Pandas is a widely-used library for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures like DataFrames and Series, along with a variety of functions and methods for data manipulation, aggregation, and transformation.

PySpark with Azure Databricks: We will also explore data wrangling using PySpark, which is a Python API for Apache Spark, a distributed computing framework. We'll leverage Azure Databricks, a cloud-based platform for big data analytics, to work with large-scale datasets and perform data wrangling tasks using PySpark.

Topics Covered
In this tutorial, we will cover the following topics:

Introduction to Data Wrangling: Understanding the importance of data wrangling and its role in data analysis.
Data Cleaning: Techniques for handling missing values, handling duplicates, and dealing with outliers.
Data Transformation: Transforming and manipulating data using Pandas functions and methods.
Data Aggregation: Aggregating data, grouping by columns, and performing summary statistics.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features, extracting information from existing data, and data normalization.
Introduction to PySpark with Azure Databricks: Setting up Azure Databricks, working with PySpark DataFrames, and performing data wrangling tasks at scale.
Exercise: A hands-on exercise using PySpark with Azure Databricks to wrangle a large dataset and prepare it for analysis.
Requirements
To follow along with this tutorial, you'll need the following:

Python installed on your machine (version 3.x recommended)
Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE of your choice
Pandas library installed (pip install pandas)
PySpark library installed (pip install pyspark)
Access to an Azure Databricks workspace (optional, for the exercise)
Getting Started
To get started, clone or download the tutorial repository from GitHub. Each section of the tutorial will be provided in separate Jupyter Notebook files, along with the necessary datasets for practice.

Feel free to explore and experiment with the code examples provided in the tutorial notebooks. Happy data wrangling!
