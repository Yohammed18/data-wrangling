The 'weather.py' code snippet showcases basic data manipulation, analysis, and statistics calculations using Pandas in Python.


Read and Analyze Data:

Reads data from 'weather_data.csv' using Pandas and stores it in a variable named data.
Prints the entire dataset (data) to the console.
Prints the 'condition' column of the dataset.
Data Structures in Pandas:

Demonstrates that Pandas has two primary data structures: Series (1-dimensional) and DataFrame (2-dimensional), which are widely used across industries.
Convert Data:

Converts the dataset (data) into a dictionary (table_dictionary) using data.to_dict().
Converts the 'temp' column of the dataset into a list (temp_list) using data['temp'].to_list().
Calculate Statistics:

Calculates and prints the average temperature (avg_temp) using the elements in temp_list.
Calculates and prints the mean temperature (mean) using data['temp'].mean().
Finds and prints the maximum temperature (maximum) using data['temp'].max().
Filter Data:

Filters and prints the entire row where the 'day' column is 'Monday'.
Finds and prints the row where the temperature is equal to the maximum temperature.
Convert Temperature:

Converts Monday's temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit and prints both values.
